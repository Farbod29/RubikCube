## installation

clone the repository
npm i
node rubic.js

With this js file, we can generate a Rubric as an instance of Rubik abstract notion. And define functionality for this abstract obj like move the front/left/up/right and their counters by calling the function inside of the instance object.

### Next Step could be

--> move to level 2
learn deeply how to solve the Rubrik in reality by observance each surface -> write flowchart -> bring them to the code

For example, make a white cross (+) in the Front direction when the other whites are distributed in the neighbor sentence.

Use react for demonstrating the cube with a sidebar that the U U` Front Front` D D`... be on the sidebar as the button.
